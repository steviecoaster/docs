## Sonatype Nexus Installation

<Callout type="info" header="Airgapped Installation">
    If you are deploying the server in an air-gapped environment, please download the offline zip archive and transfer it to the server before continuing with the installation.

    ```powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
    & ([Scriptblock]::Create([System.Net.WebClient]::New().DownloadString('https://ch0.co/PrepareNexusOffline.ps1')))
    ```
</Callout>

The installation of Sonatype Nexus will:

- Configure a production NuGet repository for Chocolatey packages
- Configure a test NuGet repository for Chocolatey packages
- Configure Generic (Raw) repository to host large installation media
- Configure a Generic (Raw) repository to host PowerShell scripts to onboard client workstations with Chocolatey For Business
- Configure a read-only role for consuming packages
- Configure a Nexus user account for Chocolatey CLI authentication, added to the created read-only role

### Environment Information

Please provide the following information to configure the Sonatype Nexus Server:

Production Repository Name: <input class="form-control w-20 prod-repo-name-input" type="text" placeholder="FabrikamProd" />
Test Repository Name: <input class="form-control w-20 prod-repo-name-input" type="text" placeholder="FabrikamTest" />
Raw Repository Name: <input class="form-control w-20 prod-repo-name-input" type="text" placeholder="Fabrikam-Assets" />

#### Nexus Install Script

To complete the installation run the following PowerShell script:

```powershell

$repositoryArgs = @{
    RepositoryProduct = 'Nexus'
    ProdRepository = 'ProdRepo' # Please replace with your desired repository name
    TestRepository = 'TestRepo' # Please replace with your desired repository name
    RawRepository = 'ChocolateyFiles' # Please replace with your desired repository name
    Credential = (Get-Credential) # Please replace with your desired credentials
}

$InstallScript = [System.Net.WebClient]::new().DownloadString('https://ch0.co/InstallRepository.ps1')
& ([Scriptblock]::Create($InstallScript)) @repositoryArgs
```

## Validating the Installation

The following script will run a suite of Pester tests to validate your Sonatype Nexus installation was successful

```powershell

$repositoryArgs = @{
    RepositoryProduct = 'Nexus'
    ProdRepository = 'ProdRepo' # Please replace with your desired repository name
    TestRepository = 'TestRepo' # Please replace with your desired repository name
    RawRepository = 'ChocolateyFiles' # Please replace with your desired repository name
    Credential = (Get-Credential) # Please replace with your desired credentials
}

$RepoValidationScript = [System.Net.WebClient]::new().DownloadString('https://ch0.co/ValidateRepository.ps1')
& ([Scriptblock]::Create($InstallScript)) @repositoryArgs
```
