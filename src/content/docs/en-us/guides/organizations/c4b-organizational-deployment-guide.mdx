Chocolatey provides a powerful package management solution for Windows. Organizations looking to use Chocolatey for Business (C4B) are required to utilize their own Package Repository for their endpoints.
_Organizational use of the Chocolatey Community Repository is not recommended_.

<Callout type="warning" title="Organizational Use of the Chocolatey Community Repository">
Organizations should not use the Chocolatey Community Repository for their deployments. The Chocolatey Community Repository is a public repository and is not designed for organizational use. A Package Repository Server that supports the NuGet package format to store Chocolatey packages is recommended.
</Callout>

This guide is for those looking to use Chocolatey for Business to:
- Set up a package repository server and create internal repositories to host packages and assets as recommended by Chocolatey.
- Set up a package automation pipeline to internalize packages for use within the organization.
- Set up Chocolatey Central Management to deploy packages, configuration and features settings to every endpoint via Chocolatey Agent.

When you are ready to begin, follow the instructions for any of the components you wish to use in your organization.
