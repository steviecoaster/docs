## Introduction

People all over the world use Chocolatey every day to assist them in deploying packages to the server and client endpoints they manage, delivering software and configuration options to Windows machines through the command line interface or with a few clicks of a mouse button. It's a powerful solution that, when leveraged by an organization, can reduce pain points in provisioning, deployment, and configuration; increasing efficiency and reducing workforce hours company-wide.

This Organizational Guide provides requirements, recommendations, and guidance for setting up a Chocolatey for Business environment, but we know not all organizations are the same. Depending on the size of the organization or what's already in place, you may need to implement pieces of the solution to fit into the current landscape. The Organizational Guide accounts for this with a building-block approach.

Do you want a complete solution? That's covered; step-by-step. Do you already have a package repository or package automation solution inside your organization? You can skip that and just use what you need. How much or how little you use is entirely up to you; we're just here to help.

At Chocolatey, we strive for simplicity, and that's what we want to provide you: a simple, straightforward approach to starting your journey with us.
