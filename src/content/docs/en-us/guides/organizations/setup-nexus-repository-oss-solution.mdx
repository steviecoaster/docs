## Sonatype Nexus Installation

The installation of Sonatype Nexus will:
- Configure a Generic (Raw) repository to host large installation media
- Configure a Generic (Raw) repository to host PowerShell scripts to onboard client workstations with Chocolatey
- Configure a proxy NuGet repository to proxy the [Chocolatey Community Repository](https://community.chocolatey.org/)
- Configure a production NuGet repository for hosting Chocolatey packages to your client workstations
- Configure a read-only role for consuming packages
- Configure a Nexus user account for Chocolatey CLI authentication, added to the created read-only role

### Environment Information

Please provide the following information to configure the Sonatype Nexus Server:

Proxy Repository Name: <input class="form-control w-20 prod-repo-name-input" type="text" placeholder="Chocolatey-Proxy" />
Production Repository Name: <input class="form-control w-20 prod-repo-name-input" type="text" placeholder="Choco-Hosted" />
Raw Repository Name: <input class="form-control w-20 prod-repo-name-input" type="text" placeholder="Choco-Assets" />

#### Nexus Install Script

```powershell

$repositoryArgs = @{
    RepositoryProduct = 'Nexus'
    ProxyRepository = 'ChocolateyProxy' # Please replace with your desired repository name
    ProdRepository = 'ProdRepo' # Please replace with your desired repository name
    RawRepository = 'ChocolateyAssets' # Please replace with your desired repository name

    ProdRepository = 'ProdRepo' # Please replace with your desired repository name
    RawRepository = 'ChocolateyAssets' # Please replace with your desired repository name
    Credential = (Get-Credential) # Please replace with your desired credentials
}

$RepoValidationScript = [System.Net.WebClient]::new().DownloadString('https://ch0.co/ValidateRepository.ps1')
& ([Scriptblock]::Create($InstallScript)) @repositoryArgs
```
