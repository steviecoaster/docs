## Planning Your Implementation

Chocolatey provides a powerful package management solution for Windows. In order for your organization to be successful with Chocolatey, you need to setup a few key components.
The components of a robust Chocolatey implementation are:

- A Package Repository - This is a repository server which supports the NuGet package format that you will use to store your Chocolatey packages.
- A Package Internalization Automation tool - Automating Package Internalizer allows you to take advantage of the 10,000+ packages on the Community Repository, making them available offline in your Repository solution.
- Chocolatey Central Management - This web-based management tool is Chocolatey's solution for reporting and management of Chocolatey packages on systems in your environment

When used together each piece of the Chocolatey solution provides a powerful package management solution for your organization, though you may wish to deploy only the components you need.

While this guide will walk you through setting up Chocolatey For Business in your organization, those looking to use Chocolatey Open Source can follow the Repository Solution section to setup a Repository Server that will proxy the Chocolatey Community Repository,
shielding you from any rate limits that would be applied with direct use of the Chocolatey Community Repository.

When you are ready to begin, follow the instructions for any of the components you wish to use in your organization.
