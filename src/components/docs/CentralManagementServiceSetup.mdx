This is the service that the agents (`chocolatey-agent`) communicates with. You could install one or more of these depending on the size of your environment (not multiple on one machine though). The FQDN and certificate used determine what the URL will be for the agents to check into Chocolatey Central Management.

<Callout type="warning">
    Unless otherwise noted, please follow these steps in **exact** order. These steps build on each other and need to be completed in order.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
    In order to run the Chocolatey Central Management Service a user with Administrator access is required.  By default, a new user named `ChocolateyLocalAdmin` will be created and configured to run the Chocolatey Central Management Service.  In addition, `Logon as Service` and `Logon as Batch` privileges will be asserted for this user.  If attempting to run the Chocolatey Central Management Service as a different user, these permissions will be required.
</Callout>

## Step 1: Complete Prerequisites

<Callout type="warning">
    The <Xref title="database" value="ccm-database" /> must be setup and available, along with <Xref title="logins and access" value="ccm-database" anchor="step-2-set-up-sql-server-logins-and-access" />.
</Callout>

* <Xref title="High-level Requirements" value="ccm-setup" anchor="high-level-requirements" />
* PowerShell 5.1

## Step 2: Install Chocolatey Central Management Service Package

By default the service will install as the local administrative user `ChocolateyLocalAdmin` (and manage the password as well). However you can specify your own user with package parameters (such as using a domain account). You will need to specify credentials to the database as we'll see in scenarios below.

<Callout type="warning">
    Timezones are super important here and time synchronization is really important when generating SSL Certificates. You want to make sure this information is correct. Otherwise there is a potential edge case you could generate an SSL Certificate that is not yet valid. As the service package could generate an SSL certificate if you don't pass an existing thumbprint, it's best to ensure that time synchronization is not an issue with the machine you are installing this on.
</Callout>

### FQDN Usage

When installing the Chocolatey Central Management Service, the default is to use the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the machine that it is being installed on.  As a result, there is an expectation that the certificate (either the self-signed certificate that is created during installation, or the existing certificate which is configured with the [CertificateThumbprint](#package-parameters-1) parameter) that is used to secure the transport layer of this service also uses the same FQDN.

```powershell
# Find FDQN for current machine
$hostName = [System.Net.Dns]::GetHostName()
$domainName = [System.Net.NetworkInformation.IPGlobalProperties]::GetIPGlobalProperties().DomainName

if(-Not $hostName.endswith($domainName)) {
  $hostName += "." + $domainName
}

choco config set --name="'centralManagementServiceUrl'" --value="'https://$($hostname):24020/ChocolateyManagementService'"
```

If this is not the case, it will be necessary to provide the information to the package about the actual name for the machine that is being used.  When using a self-signed certificate, this can be specified using the `CertificateDnsName`, and when using an existing certificate, no additional parameters are required.  In both cases, it will be necessary to also set the `centralManagementServiceUrl` [configuration parameter](#centralmanagementserviceurl).  This can be done using the following command:

```powershell
choco config set --name="'centralManagementServiceUrl'" --value="'https://<accessible_url>:24020/ChocolateyManagementService'"
```

### Package Parameters

Note items with "`:`" mean a value should be provided. Items without are simply switches.

* `/Username:` - Username to run the service under. Defaults to `ChocolateyLocalAdmin`. This should be a local Administrator - this is typically ensured during installation. `Logon as Service` and `Logon as Batch` privileges are also ensured.
* `/Password:` - Password for the user. Default is the [Chocolatey Managed Password](#chocolatey-managed-password).
* `/EnterPassword` - Receive the password at runtime as a secure string. Requires input at runtime whe installing/upgrading the package.
* `/NoRestartService` - Do not shut down and restart the service. You will need to restart later to take advantage of new service information.
* `/DoNotReinstallService` - Do not re-install the service.
* `/PortNumber:` - The port the Chocolatey Management Service will listen on. This will automatically create a rule to open the firewall on the port specified. Defaults to `24020`.
* `/CertificateDnsName:` - The DNS name of the self-signed certificate that is generated if no existing certificate thumbprint is provided using the `/CertificateThumbprint` parameter (below). Defaults to `<LOCAL COMPUTER FQDN NAME>`.
* `/CertificateThumbprint:` - Provide the thumbprint of an existing certificate (already installed in `LocalMachine\TrustedPeople` certificate store) to use for secure communication with clients. Defaults to a new self-signed SSL certificate on first installation / reuses existing on upgrades.
* `/ConnectionString:` - The SQL Server database connection string to be used to connect to the Chocolatey Central Management database. By default, this value is constructed from the default or explicit values for `/SqlServiceInstance` and `/Database`, and uses Integrated Security (with all default values, this value will look like the following: `Server=<LOCAL COMPUTER FQDN NAME>; Database=ChocolateyManagement; Trusted_Connection=True; TrustServerCertificate=True;`). The account should have [`db_datareader`/`db_datawriter`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/authentication-access/database-level-roles#fixed-database-roles) access to the database.
* `/SqlServerInstance:` - Instance name of the SQL Server database to connect to. Alternative to passing full connection string with `/ConnectionString`. Uses `/Database` (below) to build a connection string. Defaults to `<LOCAL COMPUTER FQDN NAME>`.
* `/Database:` - Name of the SQL Server database to use. Alternative to passing full connection string with `/ConnectionString`. Uses `/SqlServerInstance` (above) to build a connection string. Defaults to `ChocolateyManagement`.

<Callout type="info">
    Items suffixed with "`:`" mean a value should be provided. Items without are simply switches.
</Callout>

### Service Settings

* Service Name:                         **chocolatey-central-management**
* Service Displayname:                  **Chocolatey Central Management Service**
* Description:                          **Chocolatey Central Management Service is a service for Chocolatey**
* Service Startup:                      **Automatic**
* Service Username:                     **ChocolateyLocalAdmin** or '`/Username:`'

### Chocolatey Central Management Service Configuration

For most installations, the default values for the Chocolatey Central Management Service configuration should be all that is required.  However, if you need to modify this configuration, then full details of what can be controlled is detailed on the <Xref title="Chocolatey Central Management Service configuration page" value="ccm-usage-service-configuration" anchor="chocolatey-configuration-file" />.

### Chocolatey Configuration

There are a number of different Chocolatey Configuration values that can be set for the Chocolatey Central Management Service.  The main setting that _has_ to be set is detailed below, and you can find a complete list on the <Xref title="Chocolatey Central Management Service configuration page" value="ccm-usage-service-configuration" anchor="chocolatey-configuration-file" />.

* `centralManagementServiceUrl` = **' '** (empty) - The URL that should be used to communicate with Chocolatey Central Management. It should look something like `https://servicemachineFQDN:24020/ChocolateyManagementService`. See <Xref title="FQDN usage" value="ccm" anchor="fqdn-usage" />. Defaults to '' (empty). NOTE: Chocolatey Agent and Chocolatey Central Management Service share this value on a machine that contains both. If blank, the Chocolatey Central Management Service will construct a URL based on defaults of the machine, but is required to be set for Agents.

<Callout type="warning">
    The Chocolatey Agent installed on the same machine that has the Chocolatey Central Management Service installed will share the `centralManagementServiceUrl` setting, so that agent can only report into that Chocolatey Central Management Service.
</Callout>

### Chocolatey Managed Password

When Chocolatey manages the password for a local Administrator, it creates a very complex password:

* It is 32 characters long.
* It uses uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols to meet very stringent complexity requirements.
* The password is different for every machine.
* Due to the way that it is generated, it is completely unguessable.
* No one at Chocolatey Software could even tell you what the password is for a particular machine without local access.

### Chocolatey Central Management Service Windows Account Considerations

* Windows Account (required, defaults to `ChocolateyLocalAdmin`)
  * The Chocolatey Central Management Service requires **an** administrative account, whether that is a domain account or a local account - it just needs to be a local admin (a member of the Administrators group).
  * The Chocolatey Central Management Service doesn't specifically require the `ChocolateyLocalAdmin` account. Any Windows account can be used. The `ChocolateyLocalAdmin` is used as the default if one is not specified.
  * Upon use of an account during installation, it will make that account a member of the Administrators account.
  * The account used will also be granted `LogonAsService` and `LogonAsBatch` privileges.
* Managed Password (optional, default)
  * When the `ChocolateyLocalAdmin` account is used, it generates a managed password that is different on every machine. The password is 32 characters long, meets complexity requirements, and is basically very strong.
  * To determine the managed password, it would take access to the box and someone from Chocolatey Software who has access to the algorithm used to generate the password (more information in the FAQs below).
* Rotating/Updating Passwords
  * If a different account with a rotating password is used, the service will need to be updated with the new credentials and restarted soon after changing that password.
  * The managed password is not currently updated/rotated, but it is something we are looking to implement once we have figured out the best approach to do so.

## Step 3: Verify Installation

The `chocolatey-management-service` is responsible for making a number of changes to your system.  A successful installation of this package can be verified by:

* Open the services snap-in (services.msc) and check for the presence of the `Chocolatey Management Service` which should be in the "Started" state.
* The installation folder for `chocolatey-management-service` is at `$env:ChocolateyInstall\lib\chocolatey-management-service\tools\service`.
* Open the Service log file located at `$env:ChocolateyInstall\logs\ccm-service.log` and verify that there are no recently reported errors. If you are on a version of Chocolatey Central Management prior to 0.2.0, the log will be located at `$env:ChocolateyInstall\lib\chocolatey-management-service\tools\service\logs\chocolatey.service.host.log`.
